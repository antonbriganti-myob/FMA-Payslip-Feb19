# FMA Payslip Problem
Inital version of the payslip problem for FMA

## Assumptions
- In regards to the pay period, the input is limited to a calendar month, which I have defined as always being from the start to the end of a month. For example, 1 March - 31 March is valid but 2 March - 2 April is invalid.
